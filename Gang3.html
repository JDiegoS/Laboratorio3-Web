	"As you all know, my brother Jerry died without any warning or clue as of who commited such a crime. Anyhow, now is not the time to put our
	guard down. We could carry on a thourough investigation to find out who is responsible for our loss, but it would take too much time and resources.
	So, you better be listening closely Plaw gang because as the new leader of this group, I say we take out every single one of those Whyos and Eastman kids!"<br>
	You say in front of everyone.
	<br>

<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:justify">

	Every man in the room stands and let out a war scream like never before. You have made a remarkable impression on the gang and have earned their trust and loyalty.
	As your next move, you gather every men available and divide them into two groups. The first group is made of around 30 strong and skillful men, while the second is
	made of around 20 men just as skilful. The bigger group, you have decided will attack the Eastman gang when necessary, as you beleive they are significantly more 
	dangerous. The other group will attack the Whyos tonight.
	<br><br><br><br>
	After a few hours, it is time to carry out the attack on the Whyos. Motivated by the thought of avenging your brother, the gang moves with all the speed and force 
	they got. Once you arrive to the Whyos' headquarters, you signal 10 of them to go in from the front, while the rest are waiting in the back. Once the 10 men from the 
	front go in, bullets start flying at every direction and immediately the men from the back come in to join the battle. Although, as you instructed the gang earlier, 
	the Plaw will only kill those who have a gun at hand. About 15 men are still alive.
	<br>
	You decide to: <br>

	Most of them agreed, while those who didnt were killed on the spot. Some of the Whyos who showed up later also joined the crew, which added around 20 men to the Plaws.
	Now the gang looks strong enough to take on the Eastman gang. Jerry would be proud. Not only are you taking down rival gangs, but you are taking over their businesses 
	as well, securing the gangs future. Although, the men who joined from the Whyos swear they were not responsible for the death of Jerry. Which means it must be the Eastman's,
	right?<br><br>
	The next day comes and you gather the men from the other group in the Gander, while the other group focuses on the business aspect. Now with the Whyos on your side, 
	there are more than enough men to take on the Eastman or any other gang for that matter. Toby, a kid from the block that reports news to the gang, comes running through 
	the door and tells you that the Eastman are beng attacked by the Peakys over at the Eastman's safehouse. Confused, you wonder why they're fighting if they usually work well 
	with eachother. <br><br>
	You decide to:

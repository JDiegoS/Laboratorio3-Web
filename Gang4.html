	The Plaw join the attack, stronger than ever. After a long battle and many losses, you reign victorious. With both gang's leaders dead, their men surrender 
	to you and join the Plaw. Your brother would be proud of you, but he is still not avenged. His death remains a mystery and the Plaw will not rest until 
	the bastards pay for what they have done.

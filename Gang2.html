	After stating that you’re leaving the gang, you walk out of the Gander while everyone stares at you with an angry and disgusted look. 
	You even hear some members whispering insults and threats to you. You go to the Pint, a nearby bar owned by the Plaw, and your longtime 
	friend and bartender Mike serves you whiskey on the rocks. If theres someone who has always had your back, its Mike. You cant count the 
	amount of times he's helped you. While you’re finishing your drink, you see 10 Plaw men walking towards the bar with loaded guns. <br><br>

	You decide to: <br>

</p>
<ul style="font-size:200%">
	<li><a href="#end">Hide in the room only your brother and Mike know about behind the counter </a> <br></li>
	<li><a href="#cont1">Get out through the backdoor and run to your house</a> <br></li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:justify">
	You quickly burst through the backdoor and run as fast as you can to your house. After running your heart out, you see three men with machine
	guns, probably waiting for you to arrive. You come to the realization that there is no one you can trust anymore. <br><br>
	Therefore, you decide to: <br>

</p>

<ul style="font-size:200%">
	<li><a href="#cont2">Go to a little house your brother bought for critical situations</a> <br></li>
	<li><a href="Gang3.html">Go back to the Gander and hope to win the gang's trust back</a> <br></li>
</ul>

<p id="cont2"; style="font-size:200%;text-align:justify">
	You turn back, hoping those men didnt see you and walk to your brothers 'secret' house nearby. Once you get there you enter the house and immediately 
	notice its terrible condition. Everything is dusty, the wooden floor creaks every step you take and its completely empty. Although, it might help you since
	no one would think a member of such a powerful family would even consider living there. You sit on a rusty chair in the small living room and pour yourself a
	drink from a bottle you found on a shelf. Now youre just sitting there, wondering how it all went south. Just a few days ago you were part of a united, powerful 
	and fearless crew. To top it off, your brother was the leader of that crew you loved 
	so much. Now youre thinking how to leave town as soon and safely possible. Something must be wrong, how are you a suspect for your beloved brother's death?
	Anyway, most of the crew act on instinct and cant think by themselves. Without their leader they are capable of doing anything, even hunting down and killing 
	a member of the family they once respected.<br>

	While you finish your drink, you hear someone aggresiely knocking on the door. Before you even think of your next move, the door is busted open and two big men enter. 
	Mike must have ratted you out, hes the oly one wo could have known where you were. You recognize the two men, its Brock and Jake your trusted allies, or at least they
	 used to be. They point their guns at you and Brock says: <br><br>
</p>
<p style="font-size:200%;text-align:center">

	"I wish it didnt have to be like this. After all you are a Smith, but after acting as cowardly as you did you dont even deserve that name."
